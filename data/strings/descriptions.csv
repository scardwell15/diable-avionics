# SHEAR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_shear,SHIP,"A modified tug flying Diable Avionics' colors that sports a small turret for self-defense. Additionally, that ship being somewhat armored can help with debris clearing during salvage operations, increasing the potential loot obtained.

Being a piece of construction equipment with a bit of flair, most crews that operate Shear tugs are merely conscripted workers and are rarely taught how to operate the ship's sole turret. Instead the weapon controls have been relegated to basic fire control A.I. to the chagrin of those aboard. The crew of these tugs often call themselves Ricers from an age-old tradition of receiving an extra stipend of rice rations before sorties, this has led to many tug crews calling their rides Rice Rockets.",,,

# LAMINAR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_laminar,SHIP,"Built upon the same chassis as the Shear, the Laminar-class mining frigate can operate in the harshest environments, breaking apart large ore asteroids then tugging the richest chunks to the nearest smelting station.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# DRAFT,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_draft,SHIP,"A frigate with a solid frontal profile, capable of absorbing a large amount of damage for its class. The broadside-facing missile mounts slightly limit its load-out options.

The Draft-class frigate is often used as a trainer for green officers that failed their aggressiveness evaluation. While not exactly intended for straight-forward assault roles, it is capable of using its Arcus ablative armor mounted on the prow to absorb tremendous punishment while carrying out its attack run. Through rigorously training them to the art of positioning and orienting their ship to maximize the damage dealt to a target while limiting the impacts received to the hull itself, many commanders hope that their fledgling officers will learn to embrace a proper offensive combat doctrine.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# VAPOR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_vapor,SHIP,"A nimble ultralight frigate chassis with a heavy frontal armament. Capable of disrupting fleet operations easily despite its sub-par point defense weapon mounts. 

A relatively recent design dating mere decades before the Great Collapse, this model is shoehorned with advanced technology on a thoroughly stripped-down Neo-titanium chassis. With its 16 pressurized plasma nozzles strewn across the hull for high acceleration evasive maneuvers, the ultralight frame can barely hold together under the stress of combat and needs close inspection after every sortie.

As this is a first response interceptor, one can find little fault in the design choices, barring the lack of any real point defense mounts. Despite this caveat, it remains one of the more capable frigate designs in locking down fugitives and enemies alike while reinforcements catch up steadily.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# SLEET,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_sleet,SHIP,"A solidly built frigate formerly used to carry trans-atmospheric missions. Its relatively large bay could just as well be configured to hold troops with some light vehicles, bombs or aid and supplies. Since the Collapse it has been used more as a long-range reconnaissance craft with some support capabilities, a role that suits the Sleet-class well given their survivability.

The Sleet-class used to be a best-seller item from the Diable Avionics catalog due to its versatility and reasonable logistical overhead. But even if the Diable Avionics Corporation had not been driven into exile, it would not be the case anymore after the Collapse: in the current vastly more dangerous environment every edge count, and Sleets have fallen from ""Jack of all trades"" into ""Master of none"". Designed to fit low-intensity combat environments and asymmetrical warfare, their bigger redeeming qualities in the modern battlespace are their survivability and somewhat reasonable cargo space that makes them attractive as a first ship purchase for the prospecting starfarer.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# VERSANT,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_versant,SHIP,"One of the very last pre-Collapse designs the local branch of the Diable Avionics Corporation got its hands on before being abruptly cut-off. It features a mobile frame that can manipulate its shape to increase raw speed, or maneuverability. Advanced integrated weaponry and the latest version of the Diable Avionics's Quantum Targeting Prediction software(TM) come pre-installed.

Developed in parallel with the Valiant wanzer and the Virtuous Destroyer as part of the Einstein Initiative, the Versant-class shares many similar components albeit scaled to dimensions more fitting of a frigate. The basis for the radical departure in design philosophy was linked to the lack of light, highly mobile Wanzers wherein only high-speed frigates were capable to catch up pursued forces. This glaring gap in Diable's tactical capabilities was unable to be filled solely by Vapor interdiction frigates. This design is provided with an over-sized power-train that can only be operated at full capacity when the main weapon systems are disconnected, hence the need for the adaptable flux network that physically moves to connect to the engines.

A design quirk that is often overlooked is the installation of an ultra-dense gyroscope at the center of mass of the Versant. This gyroscope is approximately eight times as dense compared to the standard for a ship this size, freeing up room for the experimental wide coverage shield emitter. When spun up to operating speeds, the gyroscope allows the rapid bearing changes that other Diable ships are incapable of. Maintenance crews often complain about the high pitched shrieking which lasts for hours as the gyroscopes spin down.",,,

# DESTROYERS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# STRATUS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_stratus,SHIP,"A sturdy military freighter with just enough weapon mounts to deter small time opportunistic pirates. Somewhat limited in cargo capacity, but fast and discreet.

Freight transport is almost always a dreary task, except when it is not! So as to make it a bit less exciting for those who are deployed in frontier logistics the Stratus is your friend. This ship compromises its hauling capacity for the reduced signature of military drives and heightened survivability compared to same class competitors.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# STRATUS PIRATE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_stratus_p,SHIP,"While degraded by many cycles of bad maintenance and combat repairs, it is obvious to the keen observer that this non-standard hull was not modified after the production, but is actually a completely distinct model. For a short while the Diable Corporation secretly armed pirates with these altered ships. A plan that quickly and unsurprisingly backfired when those same ships changed hands to people without any interest in sparing Diable Avionics Corp freight. As such, those pirate-themed hulls have become somewhat of a rare sight.

The Pirate variant of the Stratus keeps the military-grade hull and engines of the original, and further reduces the cargo hold to provide space for a medium-sized weapon emplacement as well as a few additional turrets and micro-missile launchers. This combination of traits makes them suitable for logistically efficient commerce raiding parties: a mix of frontal assault frigates supported by a long-range artillery barrage from armed merchants is a deadly fleet composition that can immediately switch to salvaging duties as soon as the last shot is fired.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# CIRRUS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_cirrus,SHIP,"A variant of the Stratus optimized for transporting ground troops. The extra space taken by the enlarged shuttle bay forced the removal of the main hard-point of its freighter cousin, but given that the facilities can service a wing of strike-crafts, the ship effectively gained some bite.

Affectionately called the ""Devil's Crock-pot"" for the meager troop comforts provided to those in the passenger compartment. As a matter of fact, its interior layout remains the same regardless of whether or not it is transporting marines for routine inspections or ferrying slaves for re-allocation. Some would even say it is hardly that dissimilar from its cargo-carrying cousin.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# CHINOOK,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_chinook,SHIP,"A solidly built antimatter hauler used to fuel extended operations deep inside the Sector.

A war machine is only as useful as its logistic train running in the back-lines, and any Diable Avionics operation outside of friendly territory can count on the long-reaching support of the Chinook tanker. Due to the dangerous nature of transporting antimatter fuel, the design specifications required that it would be stored outside of the ship hull, in detachable magnetically secured containers. 

This was certainly a nice intention on the part of the board that established the requirements, but it also ignored the reality of the energy levels involved in such catastrophic scenarios. The chances of survival so close to an antimatter fuel explosion are so vanishingly small that the system has since been entirely disabled during flight, and is only used at a dock for ease of loading and unloading.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# FRACTUS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_fractus,SHIP,"Taking after the ubiquitous Condor, this ship is a conversion of the Chinook tanker hull, modified to house a double flight deck. The central fuel tank has been traded for a medium-sized hard-point, useful for supporting the ship's strike-craft complement with stand-off artillery fire.

The Fractuses were designed as a palliative to reduce the need for large and expensive cruiser-sized carriers and to provide tactical level strikecraft support in small patrol fleets. Due to the converted nature of the design and the limited level of optimization that ensue, several facilities are less than optimally sized for a ship of this role. As such, the flight decks are somewhat cramped, but the crew quarters are equipped with uncommon luxuries such as a manned combat hospital or even a full-sized VR training simulator that can play cult classics like Elite Citizen.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# COANDA,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_coanda,SHIP,"A frontline destroyer able to take a punch and retaliate in kind. This older design has been modernized constantly and is still appreciated by DA's captains and crews for its spacious design and understated brutality on the battlefield.

The hull is a throwback to the early days of the corporation: A time when it was mainly producing ships for the Domain's contracts rather than designing its own and selling them to the highest bidders. Despite having since been adapted to the Diable Avionic's military doctrine, concessions to its original purpose are still noticeable. For example the much higher emphasis on raw physical resilience rather than protecting shields and maneuverability, or the decently sized cargo hold for long travels. 

One of these modernization changes was to modify the original Damper Field system to what has been named a Damper Wave emitter: instead of a static aura protecting the hull, this system generates a wave that pulls the entire ship in its wake allowing for seemingly impossible dodges.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# CALM,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_calm,SHIP,"Meant for general support of fleet operations, the Calm-class boasts high-speed Pulse Engines and a front-loaded weapon layout making it suitable for many offensive roles. 

The design's most singular feature is its ship-wide cooperation protocol system. This allows Calms to enhance some of their systems in conjunction with their drones' selected behavior. 

The Calm series is built upon a monolithic frame of Neo-steel upon which the reactive armor composite plates are attached to the outside while the internals are assembled through the honeycomb structure. This slightly inefficient process is leveraged to provide adequate structural strength while allowing a larger mass budget to be dedicated toward armor, missile emplacements and the relatively overpowered X-pulse fusion engines.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# HAYLE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_hayle,SHIP,"A destroyer stripped down to the bare minimum which allows it to include as many weapon mounts onto the lightweight frame as possible. Devastating when attacking upfront but needs cover for its vulnerable rear.

The Hayle is more a weapon platform than it is a proper warship: by abandoning the usual all-around armor layout to instead apply reinforced reactive armor slabs in critical areas, much mass was freed for weapon emplacements and an advanced Class-2 flicker core. Given the massive power requirement for all the ship systems, this vessel must make do with anachronistic externally mounted radiators. Often told in cantinas are the tales of desperate crews using the ""pointy end"" of their ship as a last-ditch weapon to impale their target when the ship's reactor unexpectedly failed, but few captains seem to be able to give first-hand opinion on the efficacy of this tactic.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# DERECHO,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_derecho,SHIP,"An advanced destroyer with much of its mass dedicated to sophisticated electronic warfare and countermeasures equipment, leaving little space for logistic facilities. 

The Derecho is a support destroyer housing a cutting edge Quantum ECM system, the complexity of which prevents true mass production. This system locally redirects a selected band of electromagnetic emissions into phase space therefore rendering the tracking ability of incoming ordinance null. For redacted reasons this system gives off a purple pulsating glow while active, and crewmembers often report of temporary blindness and numbness of their left limbs. Due to these rumors, crews tend to rotate in and out of Derechos in the span of four weeks. Officially the system has no long term effect on former crews, although the study if it exists has never been made public.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# POCKET GUST,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_miniGust,SHIP,"While ostensibly related to the regular Gust-class hull design, it is unclear whether this model was a small scale prototype that turned out too performant to be put aside or rather was a successful miniaturization attempt. In any case the Pocket-Gust translates what made its bigger brother good as a light cruiser into an even nimbler Destroyer frame. 

Somewhat lightly armed despite weighting fairly high for its class, the Pocket-Gust makes up for it with the signature ""Overlord"" system. Recognized as a terrific asset for small skirmish forces, the sometimes nicknamed ""Breeze"" sadly falls short compared to the full-sized Gust in larger engagements. The main reason being the few weapon emplacements not leaving any room to mount both offensive and defensive weapons, coupled with a narrow shield coverage.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
VIRTUOUS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_virtuous_skirmisher,SHIP,"Never intended for any form of mass production, the Virtuous-class hybrid Wanzer is not concerned by trivialities such as cost-effectiveness or fitting a strategic doctrine. What it is concerned with though is being a technological marvel to embody Diable Avionics' most advanced research and engineering knowledge. Almost exclusively fitted with handcrafted, finely tailored custom weapons and systems, this ship displays impressive performances for its size and an array of outfits dramatically changing how it operates.

The Virtuous is not a ship, it is a multi-billion credits vanity project decades in the making meant to leap forward the Diable-Avionics' technological expertise. A project so ludicrous in its scope and requirements that DA's competitors never even attempted to send their spies for fear of looking ridiculous for taking such obvious bait. A project stepping on so many red lines concerning AI development, cybernetic enhancements, and bio-computers that it would be put on indefinite hold by fear of retaliation from the Domain central authorities. While never completed before the Collapse, many of DA's last advancements then stemmed from the Virtuous project: From the rapid evolution in Wanzer performances to their advanced remote control interfaces or their Flicker Core technology.

All concerns about the Domain Authority's wrath (or the loss of their lucrative contracts) became caducous once the gates shut, and today's Diable Avionics Research Institute is far less concerned about enslaved AIs or human research ethics when it can potentially unlock a prodigious new technology. The incomplete industrial base present in the Sector only allowed them to produce a single craft, which was very publicly launched in c.178. Its performances were widely advertized, the Diable Avionics Corp never misses a good propaganda opportunity, but how to achieve those was carefully kept secret. Sometimes, from their engineers themselves: for example, the main computer is a one-meter-wide molecularly sealed sphere of tungsten alloy, that operates entirely wirelessly, including for power, without any way to reprogram it or even see its components. To the dismay of many of the most aggressive members of the Diable Avionic's hierarchy, this irreplaceable craft was never sent on the offensive but kept patrolling the home system. Both out of concerns over its potential loss in battle, but also by fear of its subsequent salvage by any other party.",,,

# CRUISERS,,,,,
# CRUISERS,,,,,
# CRUISERS,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# GUST,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_gust,SHIP,"A mainstay of Diable Avionics, these light cruisers are fast and excel in providing field support to the Wanzer element they carry. Their primary battery consists of a front-facing heavy weapon emplacement which gives them an unexpected punch but the relative lack of secondary weapons limits their effectiveness against multiple threats.

The Gust cruiser design dates back almost 150 years before the collapse, during the peak of Diable Avionics's growth when their military contracts abounded and they could afford the R&D cost for less conventional designs. Historical notes and logs from the oldest ships of this class occasionally describe the difficulty of incorporating the proprietary ""Overlord"" system, and all the interferences to the local electromagnetic environment it causes, in a relatively small hull with its sensitive comm/data sphere. 

This device allows elite pilots well protected within the confine of the cruiser hull to remotely take over the controls of any fighter hosted by the Gust. The need for an open interface controls, the cost of the Tachyon comm-links and the limited time such connection can be upheld still prevent the massive use of remote-controlled Wanzers. 

Nonetheless, that system provides a potent tool that can be used in a pinch to deliver a decisive blow. While initially welcomed by regular pilots that saw their odds of surviving increase as well as being able to learn directly from the bests, these systems have since taken a grim reputation as they can also be used to ensure a mission get carried out at any cost.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# RIME,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_rime_m,SHIP,"A light cruiser getting progressively phased out due to midling combat performance. While still adequate as a back-lines support ship, the fragility of the hull as well as its lack of dedicated Wanzer facilities has lead the Admiralty to decide to convert existing Rime-class into armed merchants instead.

The Rime-class has a long and varied service in the Diable Avionics armada, especially during the pre-Collapse era. It is quick on its feet, packs a decent punch for its size and can be equipped with a large variety of loadouts making it one of the more flexible hull available for decades. Sadly, the advent of larger generations of Wanzers that could not fit its hangar as well as newer and better designs such as the Storm-class have pushed the Rime out of the spotlight.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# RIME F,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_rime,SHIP,"As a demilitarized hull, the ship itself is only modestly armed for its size but is equipped with a plasma capacitor system enabling its shield to absorb a tremendous amount of damage for a brief moment. The ship benefits from its origins as a combat vessel with its high-power low-signature drive train.

Although they kept the sleek look, the freighter conversion of the Rime-class ships are incapable of true atmospheric entry due to the externally mounted fuel tanks, however this does not prevent them from carrying out orbital drops with light aerobraking maneuvers. The mixed cargo hold approach was taken to ensure the lightest possible logistical impact, with a single hull type able to provide for all needs of an expedition force.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# RIME PIRATE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_rime_p,SHIP,"While degraded by many cycles of bad maintenance and combat repairs, it is obvious to the keen observer that this non-standard hull was not modified after the production, but is actually a completely distinct model. For a short while the Diable Corporation secretly armed pirates with these altered ships. A plan that quickly and unsurprisingly backfired when those same ships changed hands to people without any interest in sparing Diable Avionics Corp freight. As such, those pirate-themed hulls have become somewhat of a rare sight.

The Pirate variant of the Rime-class extensively reused the available mounts of its parent design, picking a few clues from the freighter conversion such as the extra point defense emplacement. However in an attempt to limit the amount of proprietary military hardware that could find its way into the hands of enemies of the Diable Avionics, the fighter bay has been entirely removed, and the space converted into a decent cargo hold.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# HAZE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_haze,SHIP,"A fast cruiser combining respectable firepower for its size with superior maneuverability. Infamous for the hit-and-run attacks its ship system allows. 

A monstrous assortment of weaponry litters every free centimeter of space to the front of this hull. Intended to act as the primary element of an assault force, the robust super-structure was designed to accommodate an unreasonably high number of General Atomic Fusion reactors to power the numerous weapon systems. Unfortunately, the heat output of these additional reactors far exceeds the dissipation ability available and all systems cannot be run at full power at the same time for long.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# DAZE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_daze,SHIP,"A lumbering cruiser that traded its offensive capabilities for an enhanced dissipation grid and a thicker armor belt. While the amount of weapon emplacements would seem underwhelming, they can be fitted with the best hardware available, and used relentlessly with the help of the Flux Redirection ship system.

Quite literally a blunt hammer where its Haze-class counterpart is more comparable to a sharp rapier, the Daze is built to outlast its opponents. Whether it is because the triple flux dissipator banks can keep the weapons firing for longer, or the double thickness ceramic armor can absorb all incoming fire, the Daze only knows one tactic: march forward and keep hitting the enemy. This lack of flexibility has often been criticized at the Navy's Doctrine Conferences, but the results are undeniable and this ship class will continue to be produced for the foreseeable future.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# STORM,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_storm,SHIP,"Tough and versatile, this carrier gives its justifiably feared Wanzer squadrons the support and mobility they need. While slightly lacking in heavy weaponry, its ability to deploy enlarged squadrons of strike-craft makes it a reliable and versatile force projection platform.

The Storm-class heavy carrier was designed with ease of mass production in mind while remaining powerful enough to give pause to more specialized Domain designs. Of note is the wide variety of weapons this carrier is capable of equipping. A magazine-fed Micro-Missile system is integrated into the starboard side to complement its 4 medium-sized weapon slots.",,,

# CAPITAL,,,,,

# MAELSTROM,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_maelstrom,SHIP,"A slender and nimble battle-cruiser that is built around a Micro-Missile Array and a Displacement ship system. The Maelstrom-class battlecruisers are deployed as the main strategic bombardment platform of the Diable Avionics fleets thanks to their ability to mount and relentlessly fire the infamous Uhlan Siege Laser battery.

While barely capable of standing toe-to-toe with proper battleships, the flexible Maelstrom can fulfill many different roles from auxiliary carrier to long-range fire support ship. If caught in a pinch, it is a capable assault ship that can deftly reposition itself using its Class-X Phase Grazer Core.

The Maelstrom design started as an attempt to create a battleship with ""Phase Skimming"" capabilities. The hull was to be lightweight and equipped with two Heavy Flicker Cores with additional capacitors. After a few months of attempts, a couple wrecks and a destroyed test observation bay along with all its occupants, the project was scaled back. 

Instead of a proper dip into phase space that would allow the ship to seemingly instantly relocate, the Flicker Cores were tuned to only harness some of the energy and effects of phase space to move the hull in real space. An already significant feat by itself, the difficulty of which might send the hopes for a teleporting capital ship into the ""against the laws of physics"" bin.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# PANDEMONIUM,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_pandemonium,SHIP,"A capital-sized hull that has been developed and seen more use as a propaganda tool than a weapon of war. While its sheer bulk gives it respectable firepower, it is comparatively inefficient to the use of multiple Maelstrom battle-cruisers, and has troubles to find a place in the Navy's fast-paced doctrine. However, when used as a demoralization and bombardment platform, nothing else in Diable Avionics' arsenal holds a candle to the results obtained from deploying a Pandemonium-class Dreadnought.

Diplomacy is exclusively conducted with one nearby, often going through constant ""Weapon Tests"" and ""Crew Exercises"" where they fire into the hulks of un-salvageable ships towed along. The glowing unrecognizable masses of twisted metal are to be left behind once talks are over, as a macabre signature.

Given the rarity of this class of ship, each production UAC seems to have been somewhat specialized. The only UAC type present in the Sector for example provides a model with extensive Wanzer accommodations to fill a battle-carrier role, likely to capitalize on the shifting favored combat doctrines at the time of the Great Collapse. The flexibility of both roles being filled by one ship is both a blessing and a logistical curse, with no proper standard for the unique needs of a ship of this weight. 

Protection wise, the Pandemonium is quite simply layers upon layers of reactive armor slabs attached upon the ship's Neo-steel framework. Given the size and unsophisticated nature of this protection scheme, Pandemoniums have a significant portion of the displacement of a small-sized orbital port. This tends to be highly troublesome for both parties when such ship desires to dock, as the stations that have a dock large enough to accommodate a Pandemonium are few and far between, and those that do will likely need to schedule an orbital boost assist after such visit.",,,

# GULF,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_IBBgulf,SHIP,"Across the sector, there exist many unique ship classifications resulting from extensive modifications to a base design. While most differ only in minor characteristics, some Mod-Hulls (as they are called) go above and beyond anything the original is capable of. These ships often gain legendary reputations for their accomplishments in the battlefield, and become the prized possessions of elite privateers, bounty hunters, and tech miners.

Technically classified as a cruiser, this ship defies all standards due to the variety of roles it can fulfill. Reasonably mobile for its bulk, well-defended, well-armed, one would be hard-pressed to find a flaw to exploit when faced with the Gulf. Fortunately for the enemies of the Diable Avionics Corporation, this ship stands unique. Probably the result of a troubled development now shrouded in state secrets.

There are many contradictory stories about the creation of the Gulf, but the least grandiose one, and likely the closest to the truth talks about a genius hacker. This anonymous individual is said to have been an idealist that despised the attitude of the Diable Avionics' military and the blind eye the other citizens turned to their exaction. Anxious to leave the system, (s)he managed to defeat the corporation's security protocols and accessed the AI of their auto-factory. From there (s)he attempted to start the production of a vessel to commandeer and escape, but instead botched the process and corrupted the UAC's data. 

The factory ended up producing a half-painted monstrous chimera, part Gust, part Storm, and part Calm... A ship that surprisingly turned out to be space-worthy, and even more baffling: quite dangerous in combat. 

It was immediately seized by the authorities but the story does not tell if the mythical hacker got caught. Immediately every engineer called the Admiralty to give them the ship so that they can disassemble it and learn from it. However due to their inability to guarantee that they would be capable of either building more ships of this type, or at least putting this one back together afterward, the admirals got cold feet and decided to push it into active duty.

This unique instance of the Gulf-class has since earned an infamous reputation in the inner circles of the Diable Avionics administration for its decades of service exclusively spent in covert ops. Public records mention that it went missing in action in cycle 188 while on an unspecified mission during the Second Hegemony/Tri-Tachyon AI War.",,,

# ARBITRATOR,,,,,

,,,,,
diableavionics_arbitrator,SHIP,"The Arbitrator fast interceptor is one of the few remaining ""regular"" strike-crafts in the Diable Avionics catalog: the last iteration of a long line of trans-atmospheric single-seaters. Armed with a single barrel IBIS and an Artassault revolver cannon, they can bring a respectable amount of firepower anywhere on the battlefield in a very short time thanks to their drop-booster.

If the silhouette of that craft is reminiscent of a Thunder interceptor, it is because they indeed share a common ancestry. The engine, avionics and armament are different, but the overall frame still bears some similarities from what has been a Domain standard fighter for centuries.",,,

# FROST,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_frost,SHIP,"A baseline model of Wanzer optimized for mission versatility and a light logistical load. This is the cheapest series of Wanzers still in service, but the chassis solid characteristics all around, and a few updates to the design when needed have maintained its efficiency over the cycles.

The Frost is a 6th generation Wanzer but is only two generations into the space-oriented version of the Wanzer concept. The relative immaturity of the platform and its kinks have been ironed out over time, but the avionic controls are less than ideal for the extreme requirements of high-speed long-range space combat. As such the design had to be equipped with close-quarter weaponry to maximize the chances of a lethal hit: In this instance a Covet smooth-bore revolver that fires tungsten carbide flechettes accompanied by a tungsten coated, chemically sharpened monofilament combat blade. While limited in range, this line of Wanzers is still capable of handily carrying out their mission in the modern battlefield, and is not to be underestimated by standard fighter pilots.",,,

diableavionics_strife,SHIP,"An upgraded 6th generation Wanzer chassis, additional armor plating and redundant backup systems ensure this craft will keep its place to the top of the food chain. A versatile high damage Fragmentation load-out complemented by an integrated point defense system give this model a deadly reputation throughout the Sector. However it is somewhat lacking raw firepower when facing particularly armored targets.

With an additional Sub-reactor Combo Fuel pack attached to the rear of the Strife, much-needed power is fed into the pulse drives to maintain a favorable acceleration curve despite the weight of the extra applique gigajoule electro-armor. Still, the extensive model upgrades made the chassis somewhat unwieldy for interception roles, but the tradeoff is that even a single wing is more than capable of taking apart an isolated frigate.",,,

# HOAR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_hoar,SHIP,"The Hoar chassis is a late 6th generation Wanzer that benefited from a mature technological platform. As such it is a well-rounded and efficient design specifically tailored to work in tandem with larger ships. Their two AFP-99 ""Tombstone"" high-velocity guns are efficient at dispatching strike-crafts and missiles alike thanks to their exceptional accuracy, and they can quickly finish off ships previously damaged by heavy fire. The head-mounted compact Winee provides an intermittent ability to neuter a whole strike craft formation at once with EMP.

The development process of the Hoar-type chassis is still used today in master-classes on project management. The craft was produced on time, within budget, respected the design specifications, and incurred only a tiny number of casualties during testing. Hoars have since seen multiple updates to keep them relevant in the ever-evolving combat space, including improved engines, more weight-efficient armor, and better weapons. The use of a relatively large crew also offered interesting benefits when it came to multi-tasking and fine manipulations. As such, Hoars are often deployed to help with search-and-rescue operations after a battle. Their sturdy construction and two prehension devices being quite handy for such tasks.

At some point the chassis was reaching its limits and was about to be limited to back-line escort duties when the Diable Avionics Design Board decided to use this well-refined type of strike-craft to test their prototype Quantum Targeting Prediction computers(TM). The somewhat rudimentary (compared to later version of both the computer and the software) targeting override revealed a depth of untapped potential: for a brief moment the test-Wanzer was able to accurately engage as many targets as the operators could feed the system with, and once coupled with a temporary shunt of all operational safeties, it could destroy most of them in that time-frame. Sadly the system cannot be kept online for long as the computer has to be maintained a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero. On the other hand, the crews would not be able to survive its operation much longer either, especially when their Wanzer is nearly disassembling itself around them lining-up a dozen shots in couple of seconds.",,,

# WARLUST,,,,,

diableavionics_warlust,SHIP,"Slow but having quite a long reach, these Wanzers carry a highly damaging sniper weapon, a Magicbox anti-missile launcher, built-in PD on the turreted sensory package and two small drones companions. This load-out allows them to dispatch lightweight targets quickly while maintaining a 360 degrees defense coverage, making them a superb escort strike-craft.

The gold standard for defense Wanzers, a perfect balance of effectiveness at a still reasonable price tag. The Warlust chassis is for all intents and purposes an autonomous fully-featured point-defense solution. Built using a standardized connection system called MULS-P ""Multi-Unit Linkage System - Production"", this interchangeable system allows two differing series of 7th generation Wanzers parts to be matched together into a working unit, weapon calibration notwithstanding. Damaged parts can be swapped out and put aside to be repaired out of combat, reducing the workload for the rearming carrier craft.",,,

# AVALANCHE,,,,,

diableavionics_avalanche,SHIP,"The 7th gen ""Avalanche"" MBW is a monster in wolf's clothing. Heavily armored, armed with a twin shots Snub-Recson, a rack of Thunderbolt missiles and its signature D64-FLAK ""Snow Ball"" scatter-cannon, the Avalanche is already a very dangerous machine on paper. The fact that engineers built-in enough safe mechanical margins to sustain a few seconds of extreme performance overdrive is just the cherry on top of an already impressive cake.

Fairly mobile for its size, the Avalanche is the Jack-of-all-trades of the 7th generation. Especially deadly to strike-crafts and frigates, it can tangle with heavier foes when properly supported. They are also the largest Wanzer model equipped with two Haptic AppropriatioN Devices making them uniquely suited for operation requiring fine manipulations and/or recovery. Crew mess tales recant the exploits of black-ops Avalanche pilots pulling off ""impossible"" sabotage operations, planting bombs on stations undetected long before they would be used, or snatching some enemy officer in their transfer shuttle right out of the sky.",,,

diableavionics_blizzaia,SHIP,"The perfect complement to a few wings of Avalanches or Warlusts, the Blizzaia brings the much needed heavy firepower required to break the strongest warships in the Sector. Their low speed makes them quite vulnerable, so providing a light escort is recommended to ensure they survive long enough to deliver their full payload.

A bomber equivalent sporting a D13-4 ""Cicada"" grenade launcher and a Grave Light Auto-Cannon. Early models had teething issues regarding the grenades detonation timer, leading to several instances of friendly fire. Having un-powered and hard to track explosive devices floating around the enemy in a busy battlefield may sound like a good idea at first, but having your own fleet forced to fly through them will change that line of thinking.",,,

# ZEPHYR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_zephyr,SHIP,"An early 9th gen model of Wanzer that later lead to both the Valiant-class and the Raven-class Wanzers. For the former, it demonstrated the validity of the concept of multiple energy configurations via physical component reconfiguration, aka Versatile Frame Design. For the latter, it proved that larger models of Wanzers were able to stand toe to toe with frigates, survive such encounter while still being serviceable by a modified Wanzer gantry (those now being the standard on all Diable Avionics ship models with Wanzer carrying capacity). 

Despite having been designed to use traditional controls, this Wanzer also served as a test-bed for the vastly more efficient S-Type Neural Interface. Today's modernized retrofits are now using those by default and will only accept manual inputs after some minor cockpit modifications. Given the constant shortage of well trained S-type pilots, about 67% of the Zephyrs undergo the procedure immediately after exiting the production line, a fact often pointed out as a waste of resources by the administration.",,,

# VALIANT,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_valiant,SHIP,"The (current) pinnacle of strike-craft Wanzer technology, the Valiant received its ""Versatile"" designation from the ability to reconfigure its thruster profile for maximum velocity or maneuverability. This makes them the fastest Wanzers on the battlefield, alleviating the key weakness of the other models. In addition to speed, Valiant Wanzers are also equipped with a shield, a pair of Micro-Missile launchers, a PD turret and a pair of deadly miniaturized electromagnetic rifles. This well-rounded load-out allows them to effectively engage any target. Unsurprisingly, they come with a price tag matching their impressive performance.

Although the use of transforming Wanzers remains unreliable, their performance is not to be understated. The Valiant is a 9th+ generation Wanzer, incorporating expensive miniaturized TX-5 omni-shield technology and advanced energy weapons. Additionally, this Wanzer was designed to be able to reconfigure its hull components and internal machinery to maximize energy flow to its engines when required.

Due to the multiple control modes needed to operate the Valiant, most pilots get a surgically implanted neural-link interface called the S-Type device, which maps out neuron activity patterns for control inputs. Out of ten trained pilots fitted with the S-Type device, seven will show no side effects, two will have moderate to severe memory loss when disconnected from their Wanzer, and the remainder are afflicted with multiple personality disorders, psychosis or in rare instances, brain death. Those who do not survive the procedure are posthumously awarded two ranks.

While far from being the most powerful Wanzer individually, they certainly are such when measured by weight.",,,

# RAVEN,,,,,

diableavionics_raven,SHIP,"The Type-11 Raven is the heaviest 9th generation strike-craft Wanzers in the Diable Avionics catalog, thus the heaviest currently produced period. Being a good 50% larger than 7th gen frames, it can accommodate nearly full-size ship weaponry: a Grave HMG and a compact Glowtusk make those assault Wanzers quite effective against anything but the thickest defense. A compact Grazer Core and huge plates of ablative nano-armor complete the deadly package. 

While designed as a triple-seater craft to help spread the workload, the Raven can still be maned single-handedly by a 9th gen Wanzer pilot thanks to the S-type neural interface. Even with the extra volume and mass of this design, engineers were unable to incorporate both a TX-5 class shield emiter alongside a displacement system, the latter being ultimately kept to prevent outmaneuvering by enemy fighter forces. Mass production of such an advanced craft is not practical and thus comes with an eyebrow-raising price tag.",,,

diableavionics_recson,WEAPON,"A best-in-class kinetic gun able to rend most shields apart quickly, and can even cleave through lightly armored targets at an alarming pace. The short barrel and oversized projectile makes for a relatively inaccurate weapon, an acceptable trade-off given the excellent range it can reach for such a small contraption.

Built around a robust laser-cooled electromagnetic accelerator firing dense molybdenum-tungsten alloy rods. The special ammunition creates disruptive wave patterns when annihilated by shields, causing their integrity to lower rapidly until they ultimately fail.",Assault,,

diableavionics_recson2,WEAPON,"One of the most iconic designs of the Diable Avionics Navy, a devastating dual Kinetic gun that rends most shields apart quickly at long range, and can even cleave through lightly armored targets at an alarming pace.

The ""Recson V"" is a dual electromagnetic accelerator with integrated laser cooling system to flash freeze the accelerator rails after each cycle. This process is relatively inefficient but extremely fast, allowing the weapon to sustain a rapid fire-rate throughout a battle without much thermal wear.

diableavionics_artassault,WEAPON,"A quick-bursting revolver cannon that fires high explosive shells. Easily tears into frigate grade armor although the high rate of fire and short barrel limit its accuracy as well as its range.

The M66 ""Artassault"" revolver cannon is a specialized assault weapon made for hit and run tactics. With five plasma cartridges at the ready, the Artassault is nearly guaranteed to deliver a harsh message to pirates and civilians alike. To prevent wear, the gun is liquid-cooled using the recoil itself to circulate the refrigerating fluid inside a micro-tubes jacket sandwiched between the inner thin carbide barrel and the outer aluminium structural tube.",Assault,,

diableavionics_artdeux,WEAPON,"A twin belt-fed cannon with overwhelming fire-rate and decent range. This device offers a unique option to capitalize on any opening with supreme prejudice, if given enough margin in the flux grid capacity to properly deploy its full damage potential.

The M266 ""Artdeux"" uses the same ammunition from the M66 ""Artassault"" revolver cannon, this time assembled in belts to increase the burst size significantly. The elongated barrels give it a significantly higher range and accuracy, albeit with slightly less punch per hit due to thermal limitations. The overwhelming impact of the Artdeux doubles as a potent psychological tool: it can drive enemy captains to fight too cautiously, giving up the initiative with deadly outcomes.",Assault,,

diableavionics_gravemg,WEAPON,"A devastating high-powered machine-gun. This Electrothermal-Chemical gun firing penetrating slugs is a welcome addition to any loadout focussed on raw damage output rather than range.

The beating heart of this cannon is the unique ammunition fired: the plasma catalyzed liquid-propellant drives a high-density contact-fused ""Sabot"" type penetrator. Upon impact with a ship's shield, a secondary charge is detonated and adds its energy to the already considerable velocity of the projectile in a devastation one-two punch. Risks of ammunition cook-off are mitigated due to the reactants being inert when not submitted to an electric current.",Assault,,

# GLOWTUSK LINEAR RIFLE,,,,,

,,,,,
diableavionics_glowtusk,WEAPON,"The Glowtusk Linear Rifle is an old piece of technology, hence why it uses an admittedly inhumane nuclear fission fuel rod as the main method of inflicting damage. Effective against both armor and hulls, but adequately mitigated by shields.

Only a few steps away from barbarism, the Glowtusk is the result of intentional psychological warfare design. The composite uranium fuel rod is launched at speeds high enough to start nuclear fission on contact with a solid object. The low efficiency of a surface detonation leads to poor shield penetration but once the offending protection is bypassed, the explosive effect is nothing short of spectacular. 
 
While tolerated for space combat, atmospheric use of such weapons would be considered a war crime given the eon-lasting radioactive fallout they cause. Pre-Collapse trials against the Diable Avionics Corporation forced their Weapon Division to revise the composition of the fission rod to limit the half-life of the produced isotopes to less than five hundred thousand Old Earth years, an injunction that activists at the time qualified as ""nothing short of insulting and meaningless"".",Support,,

A capital grade variant developed from the experience acquired while designing the Grave HMC and the Artassault. Utilizing sophisticated autoloaders similar to the Grave in tandem with the Plasma shell technology perfected in the Artassault ammunition, the Mostro is able to deliver around 120 heavy anti-armor rounds a minute. The explosive mass they contain is enough to break any armor in few hits, and with such a barrage of shells, hits are exceedingly hard to dodge.

While there are countless instances clever engineering tricks to reduce the overall volume, the Opfer is a massive contraption with little to no concession made for ease of installation or maintenance: With half the turret consisting just ammunition feeds and cooling elements, a small bridge had to be fitted on top for a small crew to fix ammo jams or mitigate overheating issues.",Assault,,

The Winee sadly was a failed commercial venture, as the early models had terrible reliability driving up ongoing costs. By the time all the kinks were ironed out the reputation of the device was well established and no amount of rebranding could save it, especially when competing with the reliable and cheap Ion Cannon.

The early release was the idea of a now anonymous executive that attempted to drive up their end-of-the-year results. Early sales did earn them a large bonus before the issues started to crop up. 
 
Despite heated protests that they warned their superior about those problems and that the project could never have met its imposed deadline, the entire engineering staff was fired right after they fixed all the reported failure points. A subsequent inquiry did acknowledge their version of the project's demise.

Using emerging mechanics of meson-phase contamination, the life expectancy of the stream of stable mesons is extended long enough for viable military use. Although the damage output is nothing to scoff at, the limited range relegated it to point defense roles rather than assault as initially envisioned. Still, when nothing else is available, they can reliably be used against lightly armored enemy ships.",Point Defense,,

diableavionics_glaux,WEAPON,"A heavy oscillating meson emitter array with a high damage potential, but somewhat held back by its limited number of capacitors.

The ""Glaux"" Lance Repeater was the culmination of many attempts of harnessing the volatile meson subatomic particle. Issues of meson stability had to be solved by enveloping each pulse of mesons within a temporary phase field to extend their half-life. Being one of the first implementations of such a weapon, it had yet to be properly miniaturized, unlike its younger sibling the ""Burchel"".

Using such immature and inefficient technology could seem unwise for a military device, but the early development goal was to create a weapon for covert operations: the kind of application where causing an unusual profile of damage was a desired feature in and of itself to prevent traceability. Of course as soon as the cat was out of the bag, that same unusual profile became an unmistakable signature, but this was expected and further refinements on the Glaux made it a serviceable alternative to other conventional burst beam weapons.",Assault,,

The choice of positrons limit range due to self repulsion, but that same property makes them much easier to manipulate into a weaponized beam.

A segment of the Diable Avionics military particularly proud of the technological achievements of their weapon division has for a long time criticized the State for being ""too mundane"". They would deliberately eschew what is in essence a bland but effective device in favor of something unusual but less potent, claiming that esoteric weapons have the added benefit of a deep psychological impact upon the enemy crews.

By causing space-time ""vortices"" with pinpoint gravity wells, multiple weak but viable hyperspace points are temporarily generated.

Directly shaped in its low-temperature crystalline form, the projectile is uncommon in that the detonating compound itself is used as the structural body, without any outer skin of any kind. All electronic components are fixed on top of the explosive. Steering is achieved by local ablation of the outer layer of xenon tetroxide using a low power laser, and the detonation is initiated by a simple contact fuse. The explosion from such a device liberates large quantities of pure oxygen, usually triggering many electronic safeties in the target to prevent secondary fire.

The weapon fires small darts of vaporized heavy elements in a grid pattern, a generation method that benefits from higher flux levels. The high velocity, high temperature, high-density projectiles have also a decent effect on armor.

The Hexafire scatter-cannon was designed merely decades before the Great Collapse, during a paradigm shift in weapon design attempted to reduce the logistical loads of auto-factories. At the time, production lines were under stress due to increasingly complex and esoteric munitions to produce. The project director had for objective to create a jack-of-all-trades close combat weapon using the easiest to produce ammunition that could still be patented and sold for profit with said weapon system.

The disk is then subjected to an intense current using a high power capacitor, causing the metal to brutally vaporize and expand. Through sheer mechanical force it will melt and squeeze out the heavy darts. 

The ammunition is exceedingly simple to produce since it does not require any electronic component. It is also completely inert and safe to store in the turret bustle. The accuracy is only limited by the precision of the assembly, opening the possibility to sell higher quality ordnance at a much higher price.

While using a few of them might be considered a waste of resources, their strength rises sharply with numbers, and their virtually unlimited stock means they are a constant drain on the enemy for the whole battle duration.",Fire Support,,

diableavionics_thunderboltsmall,WEAPON,"A rack of specialized short-range missiles armed with medium yield contact-fuzzed shaped charge warheads. The concentrated stream of plasma can punch clean through a ship provided its armor has been previously compromised.

The FV-24 ""Thunderbolt"" is a lightweight guided missile wielding a triple nuclear shaped-charge warhead sandwiched between layers of lightweight amorphous alloy plating. Much of the cost of development was allocated to refining the nuclear charges for maximum behind-armor effects. Given the high penetration potential, it is not uncommon to see a trail of what was once delicate pieces of machinery, armor and crew be ejected forcefully out the freshly blown hole of a target ship.",Fire Support,,

diableavionics_thunderboltpod,WEAPON,"A medium-sized mount of the Thunderbolt launcher. Fitted with electromagnetic launch rails and a high-speed rotary autoloader, this variant has exceptional fire support capability.

The FV-24 ""Thunderbolt"" is a lightweight guided missile wielding a triple nuclear shaped-charge warhead sandwiched between layers of lightweight amorphous alloy plating. Much of the cost of development was allocated to refining the nuclear charges for maximum behind-armor effects. Given the high penetration potential, it is not uncommon to see a trail of what was once delicate pieces of machinery, armor and crew be ejected forcefully out the freshly blown hole of a target ship.

One advantage of the enlarged mounting solution compared to the regular rack is that it is strong enough to withstand the kickback of a launch rail system. Two electromagnetic catapults give a strong initial burst of speed to the ordnances, potentially allowing them to by-pass defenses through sheer velocity when fired at close range.",Fire Support,,
